# java-springboot-interactive
A simple Java-SpringBoot web app with functional code examples for web-java developers reference.

Changelog

11-09-2018: I found a nice and simple bootstrap template with a side bar nav, made some changes like the color and what modules i'm working with. Time to work with java backend and web forms.

10-09-2018: Don't expect too much at this point, I just started this a week ago and I have a lot of ideas flying around. My main goal now was to simple throw a minimal and simple spring-boot web app connected to cloud foundry and a external mysql database (not embedded pivotal mysql database). This is done so I can start to develop the real thing fullstack.

What is this?

This is a simple monolitich Java-SpringBoot web app that is intended to work as a LIVE cheat-sheet reference to others java-spring-web developers, with code explanation.

Goals: 

* Made a live approach to programmers to the following techologies:

- Java 1.8
- OOP Programming
- Spring Framework
- Spring Boot
- Spring Data
- Spring Web Service
- Spring Security
- Hibernate and JPA
- MySQL
- Freemarker
- Rest Web Service
- SOAP Web Service
- Bootstrap/HTML/CSS
- Javascript based technologies.

* Made a live approach to programmers with the most common used modules and functions, as a reference to apply to your own project

- CRUD operation
- Expose/Consume Web Services
- Web Development
- Database persistence
- Excel export/import
- Security (login, oauth, encrypt)

This is a no-end project so expect changes depending of my spare time. If more advance frameworks appears, take this as legacy code for reference to older projects. As 2018 goes, this should be fine to reference java web-apps for the next 5 years lifespan.
